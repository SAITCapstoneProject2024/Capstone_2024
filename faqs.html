                </header>
                        <p><strong>1. What Do the Different Units Used on Our Sectoral Analysis and Forecast of Global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Dashboard Mean?</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="important">CO2e</span> - Carbon dioxide equivalent. You can view this in 100-year or 20-year CO2 equivalent.</p>
                        
                        <p><a href="https://medium.com/climate-trace-the-source/understanding-greenhouse-gases-c7e07a312a52">Greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane</a> have different lifespans in the Earth’s atmosphere, ranging from <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/greenhouse-gases/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/">a century to a millennium </a>with the former to about 12 years for the latter. Consequently, the potency of their impact on climate change (i.e., their global warming potential) will vary, not just based on their heat-trapping qualities, but also depending on what time horizon you consider. ​(Gardner, 2022)</p>
                        
                        <h2>Understanding Global Warming Potential (GWP)</h2>
                        
                        <p>In our analysis, it is crucial to understand the concept of Global Warming Potential (GWP), a metric developed to facilitate the comparison of the climate change impacts of different greenhouse gases (GHGs). Carbon dioxide (CO₂), the most prevalent GHG, serves as the reference point with a GWP of 1 across all time scales. Other GHGs, such as methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), have their GWPs measured relative to CO₂.</p>
                        
                        <p>For instance, nitrous oxide, although present in much smaller quantities than CO₂, has a GWP of 273 over a 100-year period. This indicates that its impact on Earth’s climate is 273 times greater than that of CO₂ over the same duration. On the other hand, methane has a 100-year GWP of approximately 30. However, due to its shorter atmospheric lifespan, methane’s 20-year GWP is around 80.</p>
                        
                        <p>To accurately compare the climate impacts of different GHGs, it is essential to consider their GWPs over consistent time horizons. This approach forms the basis for reporting all gases in a unified metric known as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e or CO₂eq).</p>
                        
                        <h2>Application in Sectoral Analysis</h2>
                        
                        <p>When conducting a sectoral analysis of GHG emissions, it is important to apply the GWP values to understand the relative impact of emissions from different sectors. For example, sectors with high methane emissions, such as agriculture and waste management, will have a different climate impact profile compared to sectors with high CO₂ emissions, like energy production and transportation.</p>
                        
                        <p>By using GWP values, we can convert the emissions of various GHGs into a common metric (CO₂e), allowing for a more comprehensive comparison and analysis. This enables us to forecast the potential climate impacts of different sectors and develop targeted mitigation strategies.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Forecasting GHG Emissions</h2>
                        
                        <p>In forecasting future GHG emissions, it is essential to consider the projected changes in the emission profiles of different sectors. For instance, advancements in renewable energy technologies may reduce CO₂ emissions from the energy or power sector, while changes in agricultural practices could impact methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
                        
                        <p>By incorporating GWP values into our forecasts, we can better understand the potential long-term climate impacts of these changes and identify the most effective strategies for reducing overall GHG emissions.</p>
                        
                        <h2>The Importance of 20- vs. 100-Year GWPs</h2>
                        
                        <p>Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for major greenhouse gases (GHGs) are typically listed for 20-, 100-, and 500-year periods. The UN IPCC and other organizations standardize on 100-year GWPs, balancing the impacts of both short- and long-lived GHGs, making it suitable for meaningful climate action.</p>
                        
                        <p>Recently, 20-year GWPs have gained attention for emphasizing potent but shorter-lived GHGs like methane, whose impacts are less apparent in 100-year GWPs. This shorter perspective helps prioritize immediate, high-impact emission reduction opportunities. However, focusing on 20-year GWPs might inadvertently deprioritize longer-lived gases like carbon dioxide.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Evolving Metrics</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>To balance short- and long-term climate impacts, there’s a growing discussion about dual 20- and 100-year reporting. Scientists are also exploring new climate change metrics for GHGs. ​(Gardner, 2022)</p>
                        
                        <h2>2. Where does your Emission Dataset Sourced from?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Our emissions data is primarily sourced from Climate TRACE, which compiles estimates for all major emitting sectors to create a comprehensive global emissions database.</p>
                        
                        <p>Climate TRACE’s emissions estimates cover all major emitting sectors, providing a comprehensive global database. However, for some smaller sectors, they are not yet fully independent or detailed, and instead, republish high-level estimates from other sources. For example, they currently do not produce detailed, source-specific estimates for most food processing plants, textile processing plants, battery manufacturing, and rare earth mining.</p>
                        
                        <h2>3. How Does Emissions Calculated?</h2>
                        
                        <p>According to the Climate TRACE, they address significant gaps in current greenhouse gas inventories by developing models to estimate these emissions. Emissions data is generated on a sector-by-sector basis by the relevant Climate TRACE sector leads and their collaborating organizations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each sector employs a specialized methodology tailored to its specific needs to estimate emissions. The most common approach involves using computer vision models, which combine a predictor variable (like satellite imagery) with a high-quality source of ground truth data (such as verified, calibrated sensors at individual facilities). Unlike generative AI, computer vision models are relatively easy to verify and are not prone to hallucination.</p>
                        
                        <h2>4. How Many Years of GHG Emission Data Do You Have?</h2>
                        
                        <p>We have gathered data covering global emissions from 2015-2022 from Climate TRACE.</p>
                        
                        <h2>5. Does Climate TRACE Calculate Emissions From Individual Sources?</h2>
                        
                        <p>According to the Climate TRACE, they offer highly detailed emissions data for nearly every major emitting source, including individual power plants, ships, oil rigs, and manufacturing facilities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Monitoring emissions varies in difficulty across industries and sectors. For instance, remote sensing makes it easier to track stationary sources like power plants compared to mobile sources like ships.</p>
                        
                        <p>This year, Climate TRACE’s emissions inventory expanded significantly, growing from 80 thousand emitting assets to 352 million. The results are summarized in a human-readable format on their emissions map where data can be downloaded by sector and country.</p>
                        
                        <h2>6. How Accurate is Your Data?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Measuring the overall accuracy of Climate TRACE data is challenging because it requires knowing the exact emissions of every facility globally. While some parts of their dataset match the accuracy of existing methods, others are more precise, especially when they can observe activities like power plant operations more frequently than reported. Climate TRACE continuously incorporates better data sources to improve accuracy over time. They also provide transparency about the confidence and uncertainty of their estimates, following methodologies similar to those used by the IPCC.</p>
                        
                        <h2>7. Who Can Use Our Data and Dashboards?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Anyone can use our data and dashboards. Our data is freely available for copying, modifying, and distributing for any purpose, including commercial use.</p>
